                <div>
                    <p>
                        Hey there. My name is Jaylon Carrington! I'm a 19 year old student that wanted to show my
                        passion of Art through my skills as a front-end developer. I have always been someone that
                        always dreamed of creating designs that make people want to just look in awe or feel a sense of
                        wonder. There is so much to say that words cannot express them all. That's why I decided to
                        utilize the power of art.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3>What content to expect</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        As of now, My art is mostly on a digital medium. I specialize in creating a sense of scale of
                        tiny characters facing off against gigantic monsters. My style tends to utilize this to give a
                        unique feeling seeing something cute against something so grotesque.
                    </p>
                </div>
                <h3>My future plans</h3>
                <div>
                    <p>
                        I will continue to update this gallery with all of my pieces I have done over the years. I will
                        also use this as a practice experience to further evolve my artitic skills along with my ability
                        as a programmer. For now, I hope you enjoy my work and don't be afraid to reach out to me
                        regarding art or programming!
                    </p>
