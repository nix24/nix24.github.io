          <p>
            This website for NintendoLife is a nice example of a website that
            has good contrast as well as comfort. the white/red/black
            display shows strong colors that doesn't hurt the user's eyes. All
            content has a heading and is neatly aligned. Even the repitition
            is consistent with the sidebar content. Overall...A GOOD site!

          <a href="https://charlotte.craigslist.org/">craigslist</a>
          <p>
            If you were to first go on this page without knowing, would you
            know that this is craigslist? The contrast is non-existent since
            it's pretty much all white and purple from the sea of links. I get
            convience but it feels like more work searching for the link than
            if it was organized more neatly. The repitition is there though.
            The major problem is the lack of design. Otherwise it would be a
            decent site.
