          <h3>Personal Background</h3>
          <p>
            I was born in NJ in 02 where I was mostly born and raised. After
            completing middle school, I moved to Charlotte NC in 2016 for
            highschool. I love piano and violin and my go-to genre is
            rock/jazz-funk and Dance-Electronic . If you want someone to gush
            over games with, I'm your guy.
          </p>
          <h3>Professional Background</h3>
          <p>
            Starting january of 2022, I work as a team member for Bojangles.
            Before that, I focused as your friendly neighborhood piano tutor.
          </p>
          <h3>Academic Background</h3>
          <p>
            I got my cybersecurity certification at a jrotc summer program even
            if it felt like reading alien to me at the time. As of now, I am
            comfortable in java. I am currently learning about Python, MySQL,
            and JavaScript.
          </p>
          <h3>Background in the Subject Matter of this Course</h3>
          <p>
            Now that I have dabbled with this kind of work in my free time and
            with the itsc 1200s courses, I feel pretty comfortable in learning
            more about web dev and full stack software development as a whole. I
            still have A LOT of work and practice ahead of me but that's where
            the fun is isn't it?
          </p>
          <h3>Reasons for taking each Course</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">ITCS 3160:</span> Software Engineering was the
              concentration that I chose under my major. I hope to learn more
              about full stack development and meet like minded students.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">ITIS 3135:</span> Class dives into the basics
              of web development which really interested me. I have tried self
              teaching on the subject and while it helped me significally, I
              feel I would benefit more from a structured class.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">MATH 2164: </span>This class focuses mainly on
              matrices and linear algebra. Because of work schedules, I took
              this course so I could have a Convient schedule for college and my
              job. As a bonus, It dives into topics/skills that is greatly
              appreciated in programming so I was interested to learn more.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold">ITCS 3155: Data </span>base design is a skill
              that I feel is necessary if I were to go into the software dev
              field. Funny enough. My ITCS 3160 class also goes into creating
              databases so I feel this class would be nice to have.
            </li>
            <li>
              <span class="bold"
                >Funny story or interesting item about yourself to remember you
                by:</span
              >
              Christmas week, I was going to the mall with my cousin to try the
              go-karts they had there. We got the unlimited so we could do the
              trampolines and the mini-golf. Let me tell you, some people should
              not be allowed on a go-kart track. My cousin should not be allowed
              on a go-kart track. All it took was a speed demon to try cut me to
              bump into someone who bumped into another and...you get it.
              Honestly I found it kind of impressive he managed to cause an
              accident like that. I won't let him live that down haha.(I may or
              may not have been the one that caused the accident.)
            </li>
          </ul>
          <h3>I'd also like to share:</h3>
          <p>
            I feel happy that I can finally say I'm ready to learn advance
            topics in my field. I used to be hard on myself thinking everyday
            that this wasn't for me. It feels nice to beat my past self's
            expectations. The goals I have for now is to find a student org or
            internship to really get the ballpark rolling. Well it's nice to
            dream haha because one day I will make those dreams come true.
