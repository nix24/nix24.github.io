    <h1>Project Peer Review 2</h1>
    <p>This page will be dedicated in giving a in-depth review on a <a
        href="https://miffles2.github.io/itis3135/project/index.html">Website</a> created for a client. This website was
      created by Chris Hanson </p>

      <figcaption>Home page</figcaption>

      <h2>Home Page:</h2>
      <p>At first glance, the color scheme is a nice red/black combination. The black helps to balance out the intensity
        of lighter shade of red. Overall it's a solid color scheme. The only critisism I have deals with the theme of
        the website.The website revolves around glass blowing. Since this is the home page, It's a little confusing that
        there isn't anything related to it when a user first opens the page. I would include a related image somewhere
        to keep the theme consistent or even a small sentence detailing what to expect.
      </p>
      <p>Besides that small thing I noticed, this is still a nice home page. the navbar is nice and sleak, and the
        button that links to the about page is a nice eye-catcher!</p>

      <figcaption>About page</figcaption>

      <h2>About Page:</h2>
      <p>
        Looking at the about page, It has everything you would need for one. A relating image, and a nice concise
        summary about the service. Because of that, I don't have much negative things to say for the page.

      <figcaption>Contact</figcaption>

      <h2>Contact Page:</h2>
      <p>
        The contact page follows a similar format to the home page. Text is all centered at the middle with everything
        you need to know. This isn't wrong in the slightest. Although I feel a nitpick could be said about the lack of
        anything going on the page. I think more styling could go a long way for this page. Nothing complex. Instead of
        adding everything to the middle, Maybe have the heading formatted at the top with email and phone in a border.
        The way it looks ow is a little compact. Besides hat, this page has everything it needs info wise and makes for a solid contact page.
