    <h1>Project Peer Review 2</h1>
    <p>This page will be dedicated in giving a in-depth review on a <a
        href="https://miffles2.github.io/itis3135/project/index.html">Website</a> created for a client. This website was
      created by Chris Hanson </p>

      <figcaption>Home page</figcaption>

      <h2>Home:</h2>
      <p>First impressions, the color scheme is a nice red/black combination. The black helps to balance out the
        intensity
        of lighter shade of red. Overall it's a solid color scheme. The only critisism I have deals with the theme of
        the website.The website revolves around glass blowing. Since this is the home page, It's a little confusing that
        there isn't anything related to it when a user first opens the page. I would include a related image somewhere
        to keep the theme consistent or even a small sentence detailing what to expect.
      </p>
      <p>Besides that small thing I noticed, this is still a nice home page. the navbar is nice and sleak, and the
        button that links to the about page is a nice eye-catcher!</p>

      <figcaption>About page</figcaption>

      <h2>About:</h2>
      <p>
        Looking at the about page, Everything is structured nicely at first. The page is supposed to have a img, and a
        body of text describing about why the client is providing this service. The only problem as of now is that the
        imgs on the site seem to be broken. I have notified hris about this issue and I'm confidently sure he will have
        these fixed soon. As for now however, I can't ignore the broken img as it takes away from the professionalism of
        the page.

    <div class="container-fluid">
      <img src="images/chriscontact.jpg" alt="chris" class="img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Contact</figcaption>

      <h2>Contact:</h2>
      <p>
        The contact page follows a similar format to the home page. Text is all centered at the middle with everything
        you need to know. This isn't wrong in the slightest. Although I feel a nitpick could be said about the lack of
        anything going on the page. I think more styling could go a long way for this page. Nothing complex. Instead of
        adding everything to the middle, Maybe have the heading formatted at the top with email and phone in a border.
        The way it looks now is a little compact. Besides that, this page has everything it needs info wise and makes for
        a solid contact page.

    <div class="container-fluid">
      <img src="images/chrisgallery.jpg" alt="chris.gallery" class="img-fluid">
      <figcaption>gallery page</figcaption>

      <h2>Gallery:</h2>
      <p>
        For the Gallery, I cannot say much since the problem I mentioned earlier applies to this page as well. Only now
        the damage is more serious as any page marketing the client's services won't be shown. As per my suggestion
        above, once Chris can find a way to restore the images back, this issue wouldn't be a problem but for now, I
        have to mention it.

    <div class="container-fluid">
      <img src="images/chrislocation.jpg" alt="chris.location" class="img-fluid">
      <figcaption>location page</figcaption>

      <h2>Location:</h2>
      <p>
        The location page is pretty impressive from someone viewing the site for the first time. A direct location to
        their services is perfect and Chris implemented it very nicely. I do not have any suggestions, I quite like how
        the page is as it stands.
      </p>

      <h2>Final thoughts:</h2>
      <p>
        Overall, this page is actually not bad structure wise. Eevrything you need for a good website is there, It's
        just the one glaring issue keeping it back from being a site to be shown to th epublic. However because of this,
        once this one issue gets solved, I can say with confidence that Chris created a nice website and I cannot wait
        to review it in full once these conflicts are resolved.
