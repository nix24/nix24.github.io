    <h1>Project Peer Review</h1>
    <p>This page will be dedicated in giving a in-depth review on a <a
        href="https://webpages.charlotte.edu/bmccarn2/itis3135/project/">Website</a> created for a client. This website
      was
      created by Ethan Kalika </p>

      <figcaption>Home page</figcaption>

      <h2>Home:</h2>
      <p>The home page might not have a vibrant color scheme or anything of the likes, but that isn't always nessecary
        to make a pleasing experience for the client. The monotome colors aren't strong enough to one-up each other
        which leads to a professional balance. The intro message clearly shows the name of the service and gives a brief
        description on what to expect. Overall an amazing page!

      <figcaption>About page</figcaption>

      <h2>About:</h2>
      <p>
        The about page takes a personal turn as Ethan describes where the passion of photography comes from. It's a
        decent size and because of the paragraph structure, it doesn't feel like a daunting task to read. Everything
        smoothly works with each other. There isn't much more I would ask from the page.
      </p>
      <p>If there's one suggestion I could add, it would be to add a picture of yourself somewhere near the top of the
        page. It's only a suggestionhowever, I just feel more connections when I can relate the words to a face</p>

    <div class="container-fluid">
      <img src="images/ethancontact.jpg" alt="ethancontact" class="img-fluid">
      <figcaption>Contact page</figcaption>

      <h2>Contact Page:</h2>
      <p>
        This page really shows off Ethan's talent in design with a nice clean form layout. The form gives a friendly
        apporach with everything layed out perfectly to set up contac and the newsletter. I do not know if the form
        works however as when I tested the newsletter with my email, nothing happened.
      </p>
      <p>The design is amazing, it just needs the working javascript to bump it up a few more points for me.</p>

    <div class="container-fluid">
      <img src="images/ethangallery.jpg" alt="e.gallery" class="img-fluid">
      <figcaption>gallery page</figcaption>

      <h2>Gallery:</h2>
      <p>
        A gallery is th eperfect way to showcase his works. It is presented in a slideshow manner which is a great way
        to showcase everything without slowing down the page due to tons of images. My suggestions comes in 2 things
        however. The first is that the images are all different sizes. This causes the scrollbar to act a little
        unpredictable sometimes breaking the page. If the images were all the same size, this would not be an issue
      </p>
      <p>The second suggestion comes from the speed at which the slideshow moves. I'm only given a few seconds to see
        the image before the next one zooms right on in. I feel it would be a better experience if I could press a
        button to switch images instead of it being automatic. Besides that, this is a great concept and I'm imressed by
        Ethan's work so far!</p>

      <figcaption>pricing page</figcaption>

      <h2>Pricing:</h2>
      <p>
        Finally we reach the pricing page. The page itself doesn't need much work to be good. It has everything it needs
        with each package name, and the benefits you get for choosing that package. I only have one little nitpick and
        that is the price location. I think it would be nice to have the prie up front and bigger since that would be
        the thing most clients look for first. Besides that, the page gets the job done and it gets it done right.

      <h2>Final thoughts:</h2>
      <p>
        Overall, this page has been a delight to review. I love the look of professionalism with nice execution. There
        were a few styling suggestions I made but even when you disregard those, this website does it's job in a nice
        and ambitious way. Please check Ethan's website for yourself when you get the chance. You won't be dissapointed.
