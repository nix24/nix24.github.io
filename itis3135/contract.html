      <h1>CONTRACT</h1>
      <p>
        I, Jaylon Carrington, agree to abide by the terms of the course
        contract in my <span class="italic">Spring</span>
        <span class="italic">2022</span>,
        <span class="italic">ITIS-3155</span>,
        <span class="italic">Web-Based Application Design and Development</span>
        with my instructor, Professor
        <span class="italic">D.I. von Briesen</span>.
      </p>

      <p>
        I understand that all work that I do on publicly available online
        tools will be available to the world, and will not put information
        there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep
        private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for
        attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to
        turn in assignments may show as absences.
      </p>

      <p>
        I also understand that given the structure and content of this class
        it’s possible to find many examples online or even view my
        classmates’ code directly. I swear that I will only use these
        resources to learn, and will not cut and paste code except where i
        have properly given credit (i.e. external libraries) and never from
        my classmates.
      </p>
