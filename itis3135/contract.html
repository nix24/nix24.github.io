        <h1>CONTRACT</h1>
        <p>
          I, Jaylon Carrington, agree to abide by the terms of the course
          contract in my <span class="italic">Spring</span>
          <span class="italic">2022</span>,
          <span class="italic">ITIS-3155</span>,
          <span class="italic">Web-Based Application Design and Development</span> with my instructor,
          Professor <span class="italic">D.I. von Briesen</span>. I
          understand that all work that I do on publicly available online
          tools will be available to the world, and will not put information
          there that is inappropriate for schoolwork, or that I wish to keep
          private. I also understand that it is my work that counts for
          attendance, not logins or showing up for class. As such, failure to
          turn in assignments may show as absences. I also understand that
          given the structure and content of this class it’s possible to find
          many examples online or even view my classmates’ code directly. I
          swear that I will only use these resources to learn, and will not cut
          and paste code except where i have properly given credit (i.e.
          external libraries) and never from my classmates. Signed:
